# SMOTEWB

SaÄŸlam and Mehmet's SMOTE with Boosting (SMOTEWB) [@SAGLAM2022117023] oversampling algorithm for imbalanced data sets. SMOTEWB is noise resistant and more successful according to Matthew's
Correlation Coefficient in various data sets. It is a
SMOTE-based resampling technique which creates synthetic data on the links 
between nearest neighbors. SMOTEWB uses boosting weights to determine where
to generate new samples and automatically decides the number of neighbors 
for each sample. It is robust to noise and outperforms most of the 
alternatives according to Matthew Correlation Coefficient metric. Package includes
various resampling methods to be used in imbalanced classification. Available resampling
methods are: 

1- ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)

2- BLSMOTE (Borderline SMOTE)

3- GSMOTE (Geometric SMOTE)

4- ROS (Random oversampling)

5- ROSE (Randomly Over Sampling Examples)

6- RSLSMOTE (Relocating safe-level SMOTE with minority outcast handling)

7- RUS (Random undersampling)

8- SLSMOTE (Safe-level Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

9- SMOTE (Synthetic minority oversampling technique)

10- SMOTEWB (SMOTE with boosting) [@SAGLAM2022117023]

More methods will be implemented.
