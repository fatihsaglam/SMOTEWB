\title{SMOTE with boosting (SMOTEWB)}
\usage{
SMOTEWB(x, y, n_weak_classifier = 100, class_weights = NULL, k_max = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{feature matrix.}

\item{y}{a factor class variable with two classes.}

\item{n_weak_classifier}{number of weak classifiers for boosting.}

\item{class_weights}{numeric vector of length two. First number is for
positive class, and second is for negative. Higher the relative weight,
lesser noises for that class. By default,  \eqn{2\times n_{neg}/n} for
positive and \eqn{2\times n_{pos}/n} for negative class.}

\item{k_max}{to increase maximum number of neighbors. Default is
\code{ceiling(n_neg/n_pos)}.}

\item{...}{additional inputs for ada::ada().}
}
\value{
a list with resampled dataset.
 \item{x_new}{Resampled feature matrix.}
 \item{y_new}{Resampled target variable.}
 \item{x_syn}{Generated synthetic data.}
 \item{w}{Boosting weights for original dataset.}
 \item{k}{Number of nearest neighbors for positive class samples.}
 \item{C}{Number of synthetic samples for each positive class samples.}
}
\description{
Resampling with SMOTE with boosting.
}
\details{
SMOTEWB (Saglam & Cengiz, 2022) is a SMOTE-based oversampling method which
can handle noisy data and adaptively decides the appropriate number of neighbors
to link during resampling with SMOTE.

Trained model based on this method gives significantly better Matthew
Correlation Coefficient scores compared to others.

\examples{

set.seed(1)
x <- rbind(matrix(rnorm(2000, 3, 1), ncol = 2, nrow = 1000),
           matrix(rnorm(100, 5, 1), ncol = 2, nrow = 50))
y <- as.factor(c(rep("negative", 1000), rep("positive", 50)))

plot(x, col = y)

# resampling
m <- SMOTEWB(x = x, y = y, n_weak_classifier = 150)

plot(m$x_new, col = m$y_new)
