# SMOTEWB

Sağlam and Mehmet's (2022) SMOTE with Boosting (SMOTEWB) oversampling algorithm for imbalanced datasets.

The package also includes faster versions of popular resampling methods, ADASYN, 
      Borderline SMOTE (BLSMOTE), Random Over-Sampling (ROS), Random 
      Under-Sampling (RUS), Safe-Level SMOTE (SLSMOTE), Relocating Safe-Level 
      SMOTE (RSLSMOTE), and Random Over-Sampling Examples (ROSE).
