Description: Provides the SMOTE with Boosting (SMOTEWB) algorithm. See
      F. SaÄŸlam, M. A. Cengiz (2022) <doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117023>. It is a
      SMOTE-based resampling technique which creates synthetic data on the links 
      between nearest neighbors. SMOTEWB uses boosting weights to determine where
      to generate new samples and automatically decides the number of neighbors 
      for each sample. It is robust to noise and outperforms most of the 
      alternatives according to Matthew Correlation Coefficient metric.
      Alternative resampling methods are also available in the package.
